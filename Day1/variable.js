// difference between let and const =>
    // let is a block scoped variable // const is a block scoped variable  
    // let is mutable // const is immutable
    // let is a variable // const is a constant
    // what is mutable? // mutable means that the value of the variable can be changed
const studentId = 20222051010
let studentName = "Ratul Hasan"

//studentId =1; -> it's const can't be changed
studentName = "Ratul Hasan Rabbi"

// console.log(studentId);
// console.log(studentName);
console.table([studentId,studentName]);
